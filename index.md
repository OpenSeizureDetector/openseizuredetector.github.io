# About OpenSeizureDetector
Open Seizure Detector is a system to detect a tonic-clonic epileptic seizure and raise an alarm to warn a carer that the user may need assistance.   

It uses a smart watch and an Android Phone to:

  - Measure and analyse the user's movement to detect if the movement is consistent with a seizure.
  - Measure the user's heart rate and identify abnormal heart rate.
  - Raise an alarm if the movment or heart rate are consistent with a seizure by:
      - Generating an alarm sound from the phone.
      - (optionally) sending an SMS text meassage to selected phone numbers
      - (optionally) generating alarm sounds from other devices connected over wifi.
  - Users have the option of signing up to a Data Sharing database to log the data associated with real seizures or false alarms to help with further development of the seizure detection system.
