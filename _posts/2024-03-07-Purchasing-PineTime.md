Purchasing a PineTime Watch
===========================

I recently purchased three PineTime watches from the [Pine64 global store](https://pine64.com/product/pinetime-smartwatch-sealed/), and had them shipped to the UK.

The total cost was $92.96, which included $11.99 shipping, giving a unit cost of $30.99.   This worked out as £76.88 total, £25.63 per item.
The shipping cost would have been the same if I had only ordered one watch, which would give a unit price of $26.99 + $11.99 shipping = $38.98, which would be £32.24 for a single watch shipped to the uk.

I placed the order on 10/02/2024, but it was Chinese new year, so I was told it would not be processed until after the holiday.  The order was shipped on 19/02/2024 and arrived on 07/03/2024, so shipping took about 16 days if we take off the effect of the New Year holiday.

So it should be possible for users to have a PineTime watch shipped to the uk for less than £35 and it is likely to be delivered in 2-3 weeks.

There is also an Pine64 EU store which stocks PineTime watches.  They charge more, but delivery is likely to be quicker - I have not tried that.
