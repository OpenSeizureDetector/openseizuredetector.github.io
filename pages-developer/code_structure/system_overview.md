# System Overview

## End User Apps
  - The system is centred around the main [OSD Android App](./osd_android_app.html).
  - The OSD Android App receives data from watches using custom watch apps, which are specific to each supported device:
     - Garmin: ([GarminSD](./garmin_watch_app)) 
       - Note that there is a Fitbit watch app ([Fitbit_SD](./fitbit_watch_app.md)) which uses the same web interface as GarminSD but we have experienced connection reliability problems with the fitbit companion app so this is not currently supported.
     - Pine Time ([PineTimeSD](./pinetime_watch_app.md).
