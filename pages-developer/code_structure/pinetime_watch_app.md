# PineTime Watch App
     - Pine Time ([PineTimeSD](https://github.com/OpenSeizureDetector/PineTimeSD)).   This sends data to the phone directly using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and does not require a companion app to run, although the open source [GadgetBridge](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.espruino.gadgetbridge.banglejs&hl=en) app is used to install the PineTimeSD firmware on the watch during the initial set-up.
