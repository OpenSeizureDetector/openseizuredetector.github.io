# Fitbit Watch App
Fitbit watch app ([Fitbit_SD](https://github.com/OpenSeizureDetector/Fitbit_SD)) which uses the same web interface as GarminSD and uses the proprietary Fitbit companion app as the interface, similar to Garmin Connect.   We have experienced connection reliability problems with the fitbit companion app so this is not currently supported.
